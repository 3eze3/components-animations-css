# Animations CSS and Components 

Hello! This is part of my project called ARCH. But the only thing you really need to know is that this repo is completely free, and Iâ€™ve explained each animation in a video on my Instagram.

**The objective of this repo is to:**
- Improve my CSS skills to a high level
- Contribute to people who are learning CSS


**My goal is to finish all 552 animations in 5 months and master CSS.**
