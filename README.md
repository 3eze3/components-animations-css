# 🎨 CSS Animations & Components — Project ARCH

Welcome! 👋  
This repository is part of a larger personal project called **ARCH**, focused entirely on mastering advanced CSS animation techniques and component-based design.

The only thing you really need to know is:  
**This repo is 100% free and open-source**, and each animation is explained in a short, easy-to-follow video that I share on my [Instagram](#).

## 🎯 Project Objectives

This repository exists for two main reasons:

- 💡 To push my **CSS skills to an advanced level**, exploring both basic and complex animation techniques.
- 🤝 To **help others who are learning CSS** by sharing clean, organized, and reusable animation examples.

## 🏁 Personal Challenge

As part of this journey, I’ve set myself a challenge:

> 🔥 Create **552 unique CSS animations** in just **5 months**  
> 🧠 Document and share each one to **master CSS through practice**

From transitions and keyframes to hover effects and component animation, this project aims to cover it all — with consistency, creativity, and clean code.

## 📂 Content Overview

Here you'll find a categorized list of folders, each containing a unique animation or UI component.  
I’ll continue updating this list as I progress through the challenge.
