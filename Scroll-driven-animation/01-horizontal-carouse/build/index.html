        <h1 class="main__title">The Polar Bear</h1>
        <p class="main__info">
          The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a hypercarnivorous species of
          bear. Its native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle,
          encompassing the Arctic Ocean and its surrounding seas and landmasses,
          which includes the northernmost regions of North America and Eurasia.
          It is the largest extant bear species, as well as the largest extant
          land carnivore. A boar (adult male) weighs around 350–700 kg
          (770–1,540 lb), while a sow (adult female) is about half that size.
          Although it is the sister species of the brown bear, it has evolved to
          occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics
          adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open
          water, and for hunting seals, which make up most of its diet. Although
          most polar bears are born on land, they spend most of their time on
          the sea ice. Their scientific name means "maritime bear" and derives
          from this fact. Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from
          the edge of sea ice, often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is
          present. Because of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are
          classified as marine mammals.

        <p class="main__info">
          Because of expected habitat loss caused by climate change, the polar
          bear is classified as a vulnerable species. For decades, large-scale
          hunting raised international concern for the future of the species,
          but populations rebounded after controls and quotas began to take
          effect. For thousands of years, the polar bear has been a key figure
          in the material, spiritual, and cultural life of circumpolar peoples,
          and polar bears remain important in their cultures. Historically, the
          polar bear has also been known as the "white bear". It is sometimes
          referred to as the "nanook", based on the Inuit term nanuq.
